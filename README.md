# Tinder-Matching-Analysis
The purpose of this research was to compare Tinder matches from different cities around the world.
In each city the data observed was,the Predominant language, the number of matches and messages per match, the average type of text and and average characters per opening text. This study was done swiping across the world for women and men.The data observed for women was majoritively collected in North America.
In each City the Tinder profile was the same. There was no bio and there were no pictures that would indicate where the researchers were from.
The location for each researcher was turned off so swipers being observed would not be deterred from swiping someone so far away.
One hundred people were swiped on. The researchers would not look who they were swiping on so there would be no bias.
The researchers waited 24 hours to give each person a chance to see if there was a match and message the researcher.
The researchers would never message first. The people swiped on were in the age group 18-25 and in each city a 50 mile radius was set to avoid only looking at one side or specific part of the city. 
The collection of this data is inspired by a TikTok by Amanda Jagg (@amandajagg)
The data observed is interesting because it will give insight to the standards of beauty and online dating culture around the world. 
One of the researchers is a black women swiping with men around the world, named Emma, and the other is a white blonde women swiping with women around the world, named Jane.
Since the researchers are dealing with different languages, to collect the average characters per text message, the messages were translated to English and the translated sentence was counted.
