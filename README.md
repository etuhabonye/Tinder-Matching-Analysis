# Tinder-Matching-Analysis
The purpose of this research was to compare Tinder matches from different cities around the world to analyze different dating patterns across the world

### Variables:
In each city the data observed was,the predominant language, the number of matches and messages per match, the average type of text and and average characters per opening text.

### Methods/Data Collection:
This study was done swiping across the world for women and men.The data observed for women was majoritively collected in North America.
In each City the Tinder profile was the same. There was no bio and there were no pictures that would indicate where the researchers were from.
The location for each researcher was turned off so swipers being observed would not be deterred from swiping someone so far away.
One hundred people were swiped on. The researchers would not look who they were swiping on so there would be no bias.
The researchers waited 24 hours to give each person a chance to see if there was a match and message the researcher.
The researchers would never message first. The people swiped on were in the age group 18-25 and in each city a 50 mile radius was set to avoid only looking at one side or specific part of the city. Since the researchers are dealing with different languages, to collect the average characters per text message, the messages were translated to English and the translated sentence was counted.
